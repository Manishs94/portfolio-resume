Scalable visual user interface elements were created, and high-fidelity wireframes were created using Adobe XD. User interface components like CTAs, layouts, target links, landing pages, and banner ads were rigorously tested.  Also created full stack solutions and continuous delivery frameworks to help financial lending software teams produce faster and higher-quality solutions. Extensive knowledge in developing and maintaining applications using JSX, React.JS, Micro-Frontend, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and React.JS. Used react-router to convert the application into a Single Page Application, and had expertise with React components, Forms, Events, Keys, and Router.
